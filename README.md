# experimental.milesburton.com

A development container configuration for Astro projects with comprehensive tooling and extensions, centred around a documentation-first approach.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites:**

   - Docker Desktop installed and running
   - Visual Studio Code with Remote Development extension pack
   - Git

2. **Setup:**

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/milesburton/astro-blog

   # Open in VS Code
   code [project-directory]
   ```

3. **Development Container:**
   - When VS Code opens, you'll see a prompt to "Reopen in Container"
   - Click "Reopen in Container" to start the dev container
   - Wait for the container to build (this may take a few minutes on first run)

## üìö Documentation First

This project follows a documentation-first approach. The documentation site serves as the primary entry point for developers:

1. **Start the docs:**

   ```bash
   # From the root directory
   pnpm dev

   # Or specifically start just the docs
   pnpm --filter "@experimental.milesburton.com/docs" dev
   ```

2. **Access the docs:**
   - Open http://localhost:4321 in your browser
   - This is your primary development hub!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Dev Container Issues

1. **Git hooks not working:**

   - If git hooks (husky) are not working, run:
     ```bash
     git config --unset core.hookspath
     ```
   - This ensures Git uses the correct hooks path for the project

1. **Container fails to build:**

   - Ensure Docker Desktop is running
   - Try rebuilding the container: Command Palette -> "Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container"

1. **Port conflicts:**

   - The docs run on port 4321 by default
   - If you see port conflicts, check for other running services
   - The container forwards port 3000 by default for additional services

1. **Node modules issues:**

   - Within the container, try:
     ```bash
     pnpm clean
     pnpm install
     ```

1. **Persistence issues:**
   - If settings aren't persisting between sessions, check Docker volume mounts
   - Verify Docker has necessary permissions
